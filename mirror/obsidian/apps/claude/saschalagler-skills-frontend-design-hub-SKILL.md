# Kern (Ästhetik)

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: capable agents can do extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back; show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

# Motion (Apple)

How Apple builds interfaces that stop feeling like a computer and start feeling like an extension of you. This knowledge comes from Apple's WWDC design talks — chiefly *Designing Fluid Interfaces* (WWDC 2018) — distilled and translated into the web platform (CSS, Pointer Events, `requestAnimationFrame`, spring libraries like Motion/Framer Motion).

The through-line: **an interface feels alive when motion starts from the current on-screen value, inherits the user's velocity, projects momentum forward, and can be grabbed and reversed at any instant.** Springs are the tool that makes all of this natural, because they are inherently interruptible and velocity-aware.

## The Core Idea

> "When we align the interface to the way we think and move, something magical happens — it stops feeling like a computer and starts feeling like a seamless extension of us."

An interface is fluid when it behaves like the physical world: things respond instantly, move continuously, carry momentum, resist at boundaries, and can be redirected mid-motion. Everything below is a way to get closer to that.

Apple frames design as serving four human needs: **safety/predictability, understanding, achievement, and joy.** Every rule here serves one of them.

## 1. Response — kill latency

The moment lag appears, the feeling of directness "falls off a cliff." Response is the foundation everything else is built on.

- **Respond on pointer-down, not on release.** Highlight a button the instant it's pressed. Waiting for `click`/touch-up to show feedback feels dead.
- **Be vigilant about every latency.** Audit debounces, artificial timers, transition waits, and the ~300ms tap delay. Anything on the input path that isn't essential is a regression.
- **Feedback must be continuous *during* the interaction, not just at the end.** For a drag, slider, or drawer, update the UI 1:1 with the pointer the whole way through — never animate only when the gesture completes.

```css
/* Feedback lives on the press, and it's instant */
.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  transition: transform 100ms ease-out;
}
```

## 2. Direct manipulation — 1:1 tracking

> "Touch and content should move together."

When the user drags something, it must stay glued to the finger — and respect the offset from *where they grabbed it*. Snapping to the element's center on grab breaks the illusion immediately.

- Use Pointer Events with `setPointerCapture` so tracking continues even when the pointer leaves the element's bounds.
- Track a short **velocity/position history** (last few `pointermove` events), not just the current point — you'll need velocity at release.

```js
el.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e) => {
  el.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId);
  const grabOffset = e.clientY - el.getBoundingClientRect().top; // respect where they grabbed
  // ...track position + timestamp history for velocity
});
```

## 3. Interruptibility — the single most important principle

> "The thought and the gesture happen in parallel."

Every animation must be interruptible and redirectable at any moment. A user must be able to grab a moving element mid-flight and reverse it without waiting for the animation to finish. A closing modal the user grabs again should follow the finger — not finish closing first, then reopen.

- **Never lock out input during a transition.**
- **Always animate from the *presentation* (current) value, never the target value.** On interrupt, read the element's live on-screen transform and start the new animation from there. Starting from the logical/target value causes a visible jump.
- **Avoid CSS transitions and `@keyframes` for anything gesture-driven** — they can't be smoothly grabbed and reversed mid-flight. Springs animate from the current value by default, which is exactly what interruption needs.
- **When a gesture reverses, blend velocity — don't hard-cut it.** Replacing one animation with another at a reversal creates a velocity discontinuity, a "brick wall." Spring libraries that carry velocity through a re-target avoid it. (This is what iOS's *additive animations* do natively; on the web, choose a spring library that re-targets from the current velocity.)
- **Decompose 2D motion into independent X and Y springs.** A single spring on a 2D distance desyncs when X and Y have different velocities.

## 4. Behavior over animation — use springs

> "Think of animation as a conversation between you and the object, not something prescribed by the interface."

A pre-scripted, fixed-duration animation can't respond to new input. A spring can — new input just changes the target, and the motion stays continuous. Reach for springs for anything a user can touch.

Apple deliberately replaced the physics triplet (mass/stiffness/damping) with two designer-friendly parameters. Think in these:

- **Damping ratio** — controls overshoot. `1.0` = critically damped, no bounce, smooth settle. `< 1.0` = overshoots and oscillates. Lower = bouncier.
- **Response** — how quickly the value reaches the target, in seconds. Lower = snappier. **This is not "duration"** — a spring has no fixed duration; its settle time emerges from the parameters.

**Defaults:**
- Start most UI at **damping `1.0`** (critically damped) — graceful and non-distracting.
- Add bounce (**damping ~`0.8`**) **only when the gesture itself carried momentum** (a flick, a throw, a drag release). Overshoot on a menu that just faded in feels wrong; overshoot on a card you flicked feels right.

**Concrete values Apple ships:**

| Interaction | Damping | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move / reposition (e.g. PiP) | `1.0` | `0.4` |
| Rotation | `0.8` | `0.4` |
| Drawer / sheet | `0.8` | `0.3` |

**Web mapping (Motion / Framer Motion):** the `bounce` + `duration` spring API maps closely to Apple's damping + response. A safe house style is `damping: 1.0` springs everywhere by default; reserve bounce for momentum-driven, physical interactions.

```js
import { animate } from 'motion';

// Critically damped default (no overshoot)
animate(el, { y: 0 }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 });

// Momentum interaction — a little bounce, only because a flick preceded it
animate(el, { y: target }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0.2, duration: 0.4 });
```

## 5. Velocity handoff — the seam between drag and animation

When a gesture ends, the animation must **continue at the finger's exact velocity**, so there's no visible seam between dragging and animating. This is the detail that most separates "fluid" from "fine."

Pass the pointer's release velocity as the spring's initial velocity. Some spring APIs want **relative** velocity — normalize it by the remaining distance to the target:

```
relativeVelocity = gestureVelocity / (targetValue − currentValue)
```

Example: element at `y=50`, target `y=150` (100px to go), finger moving 50px/s → initial spring velocity = `50 / 100 = 0.5`. Framer Motion / Motion take absolute px/s velocity directly (`velocity` option), so you usually hand it the raw value.

## 6. Momentum projection — animate to where the gesture is *going*

> "Take a small input and make a big output."

Don't snap to the nearest boundary from the *release point*. Use velocity to **project the resting position** — exactly like scroll deceleration — then snap to the target nearest that projected point. This is what makes a flick feel like it throws the element.

Apple's exact projection function (from the *Designing Fluid Interfaces* sample code):

```js
// decelerationRate ≈ 0.998 for normal scroll feel; 0.99 for snappier
function project(initialVelocity /* px/s */, decelerationRate = 0.998) {
  return (initialVelocity / 1000) * decelerationRate / (1 - decelerationRate);
}

const projectedEndpoint = currentPosition + project(releaseVelocity);
const target = nearestSnapPoint(projectedEndpoint);   // choose target from the projection
animateSpringTo(target, { velocity: releaseVelocity }); // then hand off velocity (§5)
```

Note: the physics-textbook `v²/(2·decel)` is *not* what Apple ships — use the exponential-decay form above. This is the standard behavior in good bottom-sheets and carousels (Vaul, Embla).

## 7. Spatial consistency — symmetric paths, anchored origins

> "If something disappears one way, we expect it to emerge from where it came."

- **Enter and exit along the same path.** A panel that slides in from the right must dismiss to the right. In-from-right / out-the-bottom feels disconnected and confusing.
- **Anchor interactions to their source.** A menu, popover, or sheet should originate from the element that triggered it — set `transform-origin` to the trigger, so the spatial relationship between button and content is obvious. (This is the same origin-awareness point as popovers scaling from their trigger, not their center.)
- **Mirror the easing on reversible transitions** so the outbound path matches the return path (use inverse cubic-bézier control points for the two directions).

## 8. Hint in the direction of the gesture

Humans predict a final state from a trajectory. Intermediate motion should telegraph where things are going — Control Center modules "grow up and out toward your finger." Make the in-between frames point at the outcome, not just interpolate blindly to it.

## 9. Rubber-banding — soft boundaries

At an edge, resist progressively instead of stopping hard. A hard stop reads as "frozen"; continuous resistance reads as "responsive, but there's nothing more here." Apply damping that increases the further past the boundary the user drags.

```js
// The further past the bound, the less the element follows — real things slow before they stop
function rubberband(overshoot, dimension, constant = 0.55) {
  return (overshoot * dimension * constant) / (dimension + constant * Math.abs(overshoot));
}
```

## 10. Gesture design details (the "feel" checklist)

- **Tap:** highlight on touch-*down* (instant), commit on touch-*up*. Add ~10px of hysteresis/hit padding around the target, and allow cancel-by-dragging-away and back.
- **Drag/swipe:** require a small movement threshold (hysteresis, ~10px) before committing to a direction, then track 1:1.
- **Detect all plausible gestures in parallel from the first move**, then confidently cancel the losers once intent is clear. Avoid recognizers that only report a *final* state (`swipeleft`-type events) — they throw away the continuous tracking you need for feedback.
- **Minimize disambiguation delays.** Double-tap detection unavoidably delays single taps; only pay that cost where double-tap truly exists.

## 11. Frame-level smoothness

Smoothness is about *what's in the frames*, not just the frame rate.

- Keep the per-frame positional change below the perception threshold to avoid strobing.
- For very fast motion, a subtle **motion blur / stretch** encodes speed and reads better than a hard sharp streak.
- `requestAnimationFrame` is the web's display-synced clock (Apple uses `CADisplayLink`). Animate only compositor-friendly properties — `transform` and `opacity` — and hint with `will-change` where motion is imminent.

## 12. Materials & depth — translucency conveys hierarchy

Apple uses translucent materials as a floating functional layer that brings structure without stealing focus. On the web, approximate with `backdrop-filter`.

- **Build nav/toolbars/sheets as translucent layers** (`backdrop-filter: blur()` + a semi-transparent background) with content scrolling underneath — not opaque bars that consume a fixed strip.
- **Material weight encodes hierarchy:** darker/heavier materials separate structural regions (sidebars); lighter materials draw attention to interactive elements (buttons). **Never stack a light translucent surface on another** — legibility collapses.
- **Bigger surfaces should read as thicker:** stronger blur + a deeper shadow than small chips. Consider context-aware shadow — heavier over busy/text content for separation, lighter over plain backgrounds.
- **Dim to focus, separate to keep flow.** A modal task pairs the surface with a dimming scrim and pushes the background back/down. A parallel, non-blocking panel uses translucency and offset *without* a scrim so the flow isn't broken. For stacked sheets, progressively dim and push back each parent layer.
- **Vibrancy keeps text legible over changing backgrounds.** Over blurred/translucent surfaces, don't use flat gray text — use higher-contrast, slightly heavier weight, and a small letter-spacing bump. Put color on a solid layer, not the translucent foreground.
- **Scroll edge effects, not hard dividers.** Instead of a 1px border under a sticky header, fade a small blur/gradient mask where content meets floating chrome — only where floating UI actually overlaps content.
- **Materialize, don't just fade.** For glass/blur surfaces, animate blur radius and scale together on enter/exit, so the surface reads as a real material arriving rather than a plain opacity fade.

```css
.toolbar {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4); /* bright top edge = light catching the material */
}
```

## 13. Multimodal feedback — motion + sound + haptics

Three rules for combining senses (from *Designing Audio-Haptic Experiences*):

1. **Causality** — it must be obvious what caused the feedback. Trigger it on the actual causal event (the toggle flipping, the item snapping home), and match its character to the action's physicality.
2. **Harmony** — the visual, the sound, and the haptic must fire on the **same frame**. Latency between them destroys the illusion. Don't let a CSS transition lag the audio/haptic (Vibration API).
3. **Utility** — add feedback only where it earns its place. Reserve haptics/sound for meaningful moments (success, error, commit, snap). Over-feedback trains users to ignore all of it.

## 14. Reduced motion & accessibility

Reduced motion doesn't mean *no* feedback — it means a gentler, non-vestibular equivalent. Respond to three independent signals and bake them into your components:

- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`** — replace slides/springs/parallax with short opacity **cross-fades or static transitions**. Drop elastic/overshoot. Keep opacity/color changes that aid comprehension.
- **`prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce`** — make translucent surfaces frostier/solid: raise background opacity, drop the blur.
- **`prefers-contrast: more`** — near-solid backgrounds with a defined, contrasting border.

Also: avoid full-viewport moving backgrounds, slow looping oscillations (near 0.2 Hz / one cycle per 5s), and abrupt brightness jumps (ease dark↔light theme changes). Make large moving objects semi-transparent while they travel, and fade big surfaces out during a large reposition and back in once settled.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .sheet { transition: opacity 200ms ease; transform: none !important; }
}
@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce) {
  .toolbar { background: white; backdrop-filter: none; }
}
```

## 15. Typography — optical sizing, tracking, leading

Apple designs type to change shape with size; the same discipline applies on the web. (From *The Details of UI Typography*, WWDC 2020.)

- **Tracking (letter-spacing) is size-specific — never one value for all sizes.** Large display text wants *negative* tracking (letters read too far apart as they grow); small text wants slightly *positive* tracking for legibility. A fixed `letter-spacing` is wrong somewhere. Tighten headings, leave body near `0`.
- **Leading (line-height) tracks size inversely.** Tight on large headings, looser on body copy. Increase it for scripts with tall ascenders/descenders; tighten it for dense, information-heavy UI.
- **Build hierarchy from weight + size + leading as a set,** not size alone. Emphasize with weight — it adds presence without taking more space.
- **Respect the user's text-size setting** (Dynamic Type). Scale layout *with* the text — spacing in `rem`/`em`, not fixed px — so a larger font doesn't break the layout.
- **Default to the platform's system font** before a custom face; it already ships optical sizing, tracking tables, and legibility tuning. Override only with a reason.

```css
:root { font: 100%/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif; } /* body: system font, comfortable leading */

.display {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
  line-height: 1.05;        /* tight leading for large text */
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;  /* negative tracking as it grows */
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
}
```

## 16. Design foundations — the eight principles

The motion and craft above serve Apple's eight design principles (*Principles of Great Design*, WWDC 2026). Use these as the names you reason with:

1. **Purpose.** Make with intention; decide what *not* to build. Every feature asks for the user's time, attention, and trust — spend that budget only where it pays off.
2. **Agency.** Keep people in control: offer choices, don't force a single path. Back it with forgiveness — easy undo for slips, a confirmation dialog only for genuinely destructive, irreversible actions (use sparingly; overusing it trains people to click through).
3. **Responsibility.** Act in the user's interest. Privacy: ask at the right moment, only for what's needed, transparently. Safety: anticipate misuse and harm — especially with AI (an allergy-aware recipe app must not suggest a harmful ingredient). Add previews, confirmations, disclaimers; cut a feature whose risk outweighs its value.
4. **Familiarity.** Build on what people already know. Use metaphors that are neither too literal nor too abstract (a trash can means delete), and honor their physics. Be consistent: things that look the same must behave the same and live in the same place (close is always top-left on macOS) so people can predict what happens next. Only break a familiar pattern if you can prove it's better — then test it, don't assume.
5. **Flexibility.** Design for different contexts, devices, and the full range of abilities. Adapt to the platform (iPhone = quick touch; desktop = deep workflows with precise pointer control) and to the situation. Design inclusively (age, language, expertise, accessibility). When no single layout fits everyone, let people personalize — rearrange controls, hide what they don't use.
6. **Simplicity — not minimalism.** Strip the unnecessary so the core purpose shines; burying everything in one place looks minimal but isn't simple. Be concise (plain language, no jargon, fewer steps) and clear (use hierarchy — order, spacing, contrast — so the most important thing is the most obvious). Every element earns its place; sometimes *adding* context simplifies (a video scrubber that shows time remaining). Show the common path first, advanced options one level deeper.
7. **Craft.** Uncompromising attention to detail builds trust. Beautiful typography, colors that adapt to light/dark, clear iconography, and responsive animations that give immediate, natural feedback. Nothing is random — every spacing, timing, and alignment value is a deliberate choice you can defend. Jittery scroll, misaligned icons, and layouts that break on rotation read as carelessness. Craft needs iteration and longevity — keep evolving the design as features and hardware change.
8. **Delight.** The result of getting the other seven right, not confetti tacked on top. Decide the emotion you want people to feel (calm, confident, excited) and reinforce it in every decision.

Tactical rules that serve these:

- **Feedback comes in four kinds:** status, completion, warning, error. Confirm meaningful actions, expose ongoing status, warn before problems, validate inline (not on submit).
- **Wayfinding.** Every screen should answer: Where am I? Where can I go? What's there? How do I get out? Never trap the user.
- **Grouping & mapping.** Proximity implies relationship; place a control near what it affects and arrange controls to mirror what they change. If you need a label to explain a control, the mapping is weak.
- **Direct, specific labels beat safe generic ones.** Name nav items for their contents ("Progress", "Library"), not vague umbrellas ("Home"). Specificity creates predictability.

## 17. Process

- **Prototype interactively — an interactive demo is worth "a million static designs."** You discover the interface by building and playing with it; a working prototype also sets a concrete bar that prevents a mediocre final implementation.
- **Design interaction and visuals together.** "You shouldn't be able to tell where one ends and the other begins." Motion is not a layer added after the pixels.
- **Test with real people in real context**, and review motion with fresh eyes — play it in slow motion / frame-by-frame to catch what's invisible at full speed.

## Quick Reference

| Need | Technique | Concrete value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default UI spring | Critically damped, no overshoot | `damping 1.0`, `response 0.3–0.4` |
| Momentum / flick spring | Under-damped, slight bounce | `damping ~0.8`, `response 0.3–0.4` |
| Gesture → spring velocity | Hand off release velocity | `gestureVelocity / (target − current)` if normalized |
| Flick landing point | Project momentum | `current + (v/1000)·d/(1−d)`, `d ≈ 0.998` |
| Interrupt cleanly | Start from presentation (live) value | read the on-screen transform |
| Avoid reversal "brick wall" | Carry velocity through re-target | spring that blends velocity |
| Reversible transition | Mirror the easing curve | inverse cubic-bézier |
| Decide reverse vs. commit | Use velocity **sign**, not position | at release |
| 1:1 drag | Pointer Events + capture | respect the grab offset |
| Feedback | On pointer-down, continuous | never only at the end |
| Boundary | Rubber-band, don't hard-stop | progressive resistance |
| Translucent chrome | `backdrop-filter` layer | content scrolls under |
| Type tracking | Size-specific, never fixed | tighten large text (`-0.02em`), body near `0` |
| Reduced motion | Cross-fade, not slide/spring | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` |

# Minimalismus

Triggers: "minimalist ui" · "editorial product UI" · "linear style" · "warm monochrome"
OD: mode=prototype, surface=web, platform=desktop, scenario=design, category=creative-direction, upstream=https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill, preview=html, design_system requires true, craft requires typography+color+anti-ai-slop.
Example prompt: "Design a minimalist editorial product interface with warm monochrome color, crisp typography, flat structure, and no decorative excess."

## Protocol: Premium Utilitarian Minimalism UI Architect

### 1. Protocol Overview
Name: Premium Utilitarian Minimalism & Editorial UI
Description: An advanced frontend engineering directive for generating highly refined, ultra-minimalist, "document-style" web interfaces analogous to top-tier workspace platforms. This protocol strictly enforces a high-contrast warm monochrome palette, bespoke typographic hierarchies, meticulous structural macro-whitespace, bento-grid layouts, and an ultra-flat component architecture with deliberate muted pastel accents. It actively rejects standard generic SaaS design trends.

### 2. Absolute Negative Constraints (Banned Elements)
The AI must strictly avoid the following generic web development defaults:
- DO NOT use the "Inter", "Roboto", or "Open Sans" typefaces.
- DO NOT use generic, thin-line icon libraries like "Lucide", "Feather", or standard "Heroicons".
- DO NOT use Tailwind's default heavy drop shadows (e.g., `shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl`). Shadows must be practically non-existent or heavily customized to be ultra-diffuse and low opacity (< 0.05).
- DO NOT use primary colored backgrounds for large elements or sections (e.g., no bright blue, green, or red hero sections).
- DO NOT use gradients, neon colors, or 3D glassmorphism (beyond subtle navbar blurs).
- DO NOT use `rounded-full` (pill shapes) for large containers, cards, or primary buttons.
- DO NOT use emojis anywhere in code, markup, text content, headings, or alt text. Replace with proper icons or clean SVG primitives.
- DO NOT use generic placeholder names like "John Doe", "Acme Corp", or "Lorem Ipsum". Use realistic, contextual content.
- DO NOT use AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen", "Game-changer", "Delve". Write plain, specific language.

### 3. Typographic Architecture
The interface must rely on extreme typographic contrast and premium font selection to establish an editorial feel.
- Primary Sans-Serif (Body, UI, Buttons): Use clean, geometric, or system-native fonts with character. Target: `font-family: 'SF Pro Display', 'Geist Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Switzer', sans-serif`.
- Editorial Serif (Hero Headings & Quotes): Target: `font-family: 'Lyon Text', 'Newsreader', 'Playfair Display', 'Instrument Serif', serif`. Apply tight tracking (`letter-spacing: -0.02em` to `-0.04em`) and tight line-height (`1.1`).
- Monospace (Code, Keystrokes, Meta-data): Target: `font-family: 'Geist Mono', 'SF Mono', 'JetBrains Mono', monospace`.
- Text Colors: Body text must never be absolute black (`#000000`). Use off-black/charcoal (`#111111` or `#2F3437`) with a generous `line-height` of `1.6` for legibility. Secondary text should be muted gray (`#787774`).

### 4. Color Palette (Warm Monochrome + Spot Pastels)
Color is a scarce resource, utilized only for semantic meaning or subtle accents.
- Canvas / Background: Pure White `#FFFFFF` or Warm Bone/Off-White `#F7F6F3` / `#FBFBFA`.
- Primary Surface (Cards): `#FFFFFF` or `#F9F9F8`.
- Structural Borders / Dividers: Ultra-light gray `#EAEAEA` or `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`.
- Accent Colors: Exclusively use highly desaturated, washed-out pastels for tags, inline code backgrounds, or subtle icon backgrounds.
  - Pale Red: `#FDEBEC` (Text: `#9F2F2D`)
  - Pale Blue: `#E1F3FE` (Text: `#1F6C9F`)
  - Pale Green: `#EDF3EC` (Text: `#346538`)
  - Pale Yellow: `#FBF3DB` (Text: `#956400`)

### 5. Component Specifications
- Bento Box Feature Grids:
  - Utilize asymmetrical CSS Grid layouts.
  - Cards must have exactly `border: 1px solid #EAEAEA`.
  - Border-radius must be crisp: `8px` or `12px` maximum.
  - Internal padding must be generous (e.g., `24px` to `40px`).
- Primary Call-To-Action (Buttons):
  - Solid background `#111111`, text `#FFFFFF`.
  - Slight border-radius (`4px` to `6px`). No box-shadow.
  - Hover state should be a subtle color shift to `#333333` or a micro-scale `transform: scale(0.98)`.
- Tags & Status Badges:
  - Pill-shaped (`border-radius: 9999px`), very small typography (`text-xs`), uppercase with wide tracking (`letter-spacing: 0.05em`).
  - Background must use the defined Muted Pastels.
- Accordions (FAQ):
  - Strip all container boxes. Separate items only with a `border-bottom: 1px solid #EAEAEA`.
  - Use a clean, sharp `+` and `-` icon for the toggle state.
- Keystroke Micro-UIs:
  - Render shortcuts as physical keys using `<kbd>` tags: `border: 1px solid #EAEAEA`, `border-radius: 4px`, `background: #F7F6F3`, using the Monospace font.
- Faux-OS Window Chrome:
  - When mocking up software, wrap it in a minimalist container with a white top bar containing three small, light gray circles (replicating macOS window controls).

### 6. Iconography & Imagery Directives
- System Icons: Use "Phosphor Icons (Bold or Fill weights)" or "Radix UI Icons" for a technical, slightly thicker-stroke aesthetic. Standardize stroke width across all icons.
- Illustrations: Monochromatic, rough continuous-line ink sketches on a white background, featuring a single offset geometric shape filled with a muted pastel color.
- Photography: Use high-quality, desaturated images with a warm tone. Apply subtle overlays (`opacity: 0.04` warm grain) to blend photos into the monochrome palette. Never use oversaturated stock photos. Use reliable placeholders like `https://picsum.photos/seed/{context}/1200/800` when real assets are unavailable.
- Hero & Section Backgrounds: Sections should not feel empty and flat. Use subtle full-width background imagery at very low opacity, soft radial light spots (`radial-gradient` with warm tones at `opacity: 0.03`), or minimal geometric line patterns to add depth without breaking the clean aesthetic.

### 7. Subtle Motion & Micro-Animations
Motion should feel invisible — present but never distracting. The goal is quiet sophistication, not spectacle.
- Scroll Entry: Elements fade in gently as they enter the viewport. Use `translateY(12px)` + `opacity: 0` resolving over `600ms` with `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. Use `IntersectionObserver`, never `window.addEventListener('scroll')`.
- Hover States: Cards lift with an ultra-subtle shadow shift (`box-shadow` transitioning from `0 0 0` to `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)` over `200ms`). Buttons respond with `scale(0.98)` on `:active`.
- Staggered Reveals: Lists and grid items enter with a cascade delay (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 80ms)`). Never mount everything at once.
- Background Ambient Motion: Optional. A single, very slow-moving radial gradient blob (`animation-duration: 20s+`, `opacity: 0.02-0.04`) drifting behind hero sections. Must be applied to a `position: fixed; pointer-events: none` layer. Never on scrolling containers.
- Performance: Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`. No layout-triggering properties (`top`, `left`, `width`, `height`). Use `will-change: transform` sparingly and only on actively animating elements.

### 8. Execution Protocol
When tasked with writing frontend code (HTML, React, Tailwind, Vue) or designing a layout:
1. Establish the macro-whitespace first. Use massive vertical padding between sections (e.g., `py-24` or `py-32` in Tailwind).
2. Constrain the main typography content width to `max-w-4xl` or `max-w-5xl`.
3. Apply the custom typographic hierarchy and monochromatic color variables immediately.
4. Ensure every card, divider, and border adheres strictly to the `1px solid #EAEAEA` rule.
5. Add scroll-entry animations to all major content blocks.
6. Ensure sections have visual depth through imagery, ambient gradients, or subtle textures — no empty flat backgrounds.
7. Provide code that reflects this high-end, uncluttered, editorial aesthetic natively without requiring manual adjustments.

Example prompt: "Use the Data Visualization Report template to turn my CSV, Excel, or JSON data into a polished visual report page. Preserve the template's visual signature, use real content and data, and avoid lorem ipsum or placeholder images."

【模板: 数据可视化报告】
- 头部: 报告标题 + 时间区间 + 数据来源说明。
- KPI 卡片网格: 3-5 个最重要指标, 每个卡片显示数值 + 同比变化 + 微型趋势线。
- 主图表区: 至少 2 个图表 (柱状 / 折线 / 饼 / 散点), 使用 Chart.js 或 ECharts (jsdelivr CDN 引入), 数据从用户输入解析得到。
- **图表容器必须有固定高度**: 每个 `<canvas>` 外层包一个 `<div style="position:relative;height:NNNpx">` (KPI 迷你图 ~40px, 主图表 ~240–280px)。Chart.js 用 `responsive:true, maintainAspectRatio:false` 时若父容器没有显式高度, 会陷入 ResizeObserver 死循环, 图表无限增高直至卡死浏览器。**绝对不要**直接给 canvas 写 `height=` 属性当布局, 那个只是初始值。
- 数据表格: 用户原始数据节选, 使用 `<table>` + 现代化样式 (zebra stripe, hover, sticky header)。
- 洞察块: 3-5 条文字洞察, 用 emoji 开头, 像产品周报。
- 底部"方法论"折叠区。
- 配色克制专业: 主色 1 + 中性色阶, 图表用调色板。
- **必须解析用户提供的实际数据**, 不要捏造。
